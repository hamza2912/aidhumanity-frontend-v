                <br /> 6.2 Whilst we use appropriate security measures once we
                receive your personal information, the transmission of
                information over the internet is never completely secure. We do
                our best to protect personal information, but we cannot
                guarantee the security of information transmitted to our

                transfer your personal information to that country to progress
                the recruitment. It may be that that country does not provide
                the same level of data protection as in the European Economic
                Area. <br />
                <br /> 7.3 If you are unsuccessful in your job application, we
                will hold your personal information for 6 months only. After

                use it for matters that apply directly to your employment with
                us at Aid Humanity. <br />
                <br /> 7.5 When your employment ceases and you leave Aid
